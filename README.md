# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Missing Data Handling

## Project Overview
This project involves performing end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset and handling missing data using Python. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and prepare it for further analysis or modeling.

Key Features
* Data Cleaning: Identified and addressed missing values using various imputation techniques.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted a thorough analysis including data visualization, statistical summary, and trend analysis.
* Missing Data Handling: Applied methods such as mean/mode imputation, forward/backward filling, and interpolation to handle missing data.
* Visualization: Used libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of data distributions and relationships.
